;
; This rule is for sentential complements following propositional
; attitude verbs, such as "I know that you lied to me." or "I imagine
; you will make a fine garbage man someday, son." It hooks up `know` to
; `that`, and `imagine` to `will` in the sentences above.  This relation
; exists so that someday OpenCog will understand that the situations
; described in the sentences following propositional attitude verbs must
; be interpreted as 'representations' rather than 'reality' which means
; that you can't infer anything about reality from them.  Look up
; Jackendoff's writing on this subject if you wish to understand more . . .
