Combined language and animation
-------------------------------

This document sketches a proposed architecture for combining language
with sensory perception, memory, reasoning and action. Yes, such a
combination is a "holy grail" of AGI.  Yes, there must be 1000 other
proposals for how to do this.  This proposal is very low brow: it
attempts to describe something that is doable by a small number of
programmers, in a short period of time, making use of the existing
OpenCog code base, and, at the same time, result in a system that
is not a train-wreck of hack, but something that could maybe survive
and be improved upon in an incremental fashion.

As such, it will touch base with existing source code within OpenCog,
even if that source code is imperfect or inadequate.  It is up to the
reader to understand what portions of the code need to be improved, and
to do that work.

General overview
----------------
The general strategy is this:
 * Identify what is being asked (said, perceived)
 * Assemble a set of candidate answers (responses)
 * Seek evidence for or against each answer (each action to be taken)
 * Formulate a reply (perform that action)
