                     Eva Chatbot
                     -----------

Prototype tht attaches the chatbot to the behavior trees that
control the Hanson Robotics Eva robot emulator.

The Eva simulator emulates an animated human head, able to see
listen and respond.  There is a fair amount of setup needed to 
run this thing:

 * The animation is done in blender; you have to install blender
   and get the blender rig.

 * Communications is done using ROS. You have to install ROS and
   catkin and catkin make to build the ROS messages.

 * Behavior control is done with OpenCog behavior trees.

See the directory
https://github.com/opencog/ros-behavior-scripting
for additional information.  It will give pointers as to how to
install and cofigure the above pieces.

Goals
-----
Goals for this chatbot are:

 * Respond to verbal commands, such as "Turn left" or "Don't
   look at me." (she's always looking at you)

 * Answer queries about internal state, such as "Can you see me?"
   "Did you just smile?"

 * Remember things.  e.g. "My name is X"

 * Conduct a reasonably pleasant conversation.
